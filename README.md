# ERP-Design

                        Enterprise resource planning (ERP) is the integrated management of core business processes, often in real-time and mediated by software and technology. The ERP system integrates varied organizational systems and facilitates error-free transactions and production, thereby enhancing the organization's efficiency. ERP systems run on a variety of computer hardware and network configurations, typically using a database as an information repository. It organizes and integrates operation processes and information flows to make optimum use of resources such as men, material, money and machine.
Enterprise resource planning promises:
a)	 one database,  
b)	 one application,  
c)	 One user interface .
For the entire enterprise, where once disparate systems ruled manufacturing, distribution, finance and sales.
In this project I will try to implement a demo ERP model which is based on The Education field out of the various ones.
It basically consists of:-
1)	Student Management System
2)	Faculty/Staff  Management System
3)	Online Examination.
